# Transactions per day graphing
Use the Jupyter notebook provided to graph the average transactions per day on various blockchains, in a determined period of time, in a pie graph.

You'll need to download the databases containing the info of daily transactions, these can be found here: https://coinmetrics.io/data-downloads/. Alternatively you can use Coinmetrics' tool to download the databases automatically: https://github.com/whateverpal/coinmetrics-tools. These databases also include other data such as total price in USD, marketcap, and fees.

The plotly library allows the creation of interactive charts. I strongly suggest signing up at: https://plot.ly/, since with an account you can save your plots on their cloud service for ease of share-ability, allowing you to embed them on your websites, and even download them in HTML.
